<h1><a href="index.php">Home</a> - Trends in Computer Science - Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>I chose Cloud computing as the trend that I will be researching.</p>

<h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
    <p>Cloud computing in the raw form simply means that you are accessing data remotely over the internet, this could be you checking you GMail account, your HDSB Email, your marks for this course. It all can be qualified
    as cloud computing to an extent. When people think of cloud computing, they think of either "invisible" computers that will do everything for them, or they will think of a giant datacentre which
    which holds the world's data, ready for all people to access it.</p>
    <p>The cloud computing market is absoloutely massive, to give it some scale, <a href="http://247wallst.com/technology-3/2015/03/07/the-270-billon-cloud-computing-market/">it is thought that it will be
        worth $270 Billion per year by 2020.</a></p>
    <p>Now, if you have a NAS(Network Attached Storage) server at home and you are accessing the backups or whatever files on it from the same network, that's not cloud computing. However, if you were to
    expose that server to the internet for you to access outside the network, that would be cloud computing in the sense of data storage. Which gets us to the next point, the different types of cloud.</p>
    <p>Just for some showey offey time, here is my personal cloud/home server setup. I use it to remotely run my entire house, meaning all my information is stored on these servers. I am planning
    on upgrading shortly, due to the servers being archaic nearly. This is a cloud because it runs remote access clients, such as my VPN server, as well as a slew of VM's on VMWare VCenter.</p>

<h3>Types of Cloud</h3>
<p>These are "explanations" of the IaaS/SaaS/PaaS Pyramid</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Storage Cloud</b> - Such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive</li>
    <li><b>Backup Cloud</b> - Such as Backblaze, or another offsite backup platform</li>
    <li><b>Application Cloud</b> - Such as Microsoft Office 365 or Office Online where the application is hosted remotely for you to access at any time</li>
    <li><b>Private Cloud</b> - Such as a remotely hosted VPS or Dedicated server for a company to use for any of the above or below uses.</li>
    <li><b>Public Cloud</b> - Shared hosting, such as web hosting.</li>
    <li><b>Compute Cloud</b> - Remote computing cloud, such as Nvidia Grid - Which is a remotely hosted extremely powerful computing server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, without some sort of image, those would be boring and useless right? So pretty picture time!</p>

<p><b>SaaS</b> - Software as a Service - Used by every day users<br/>
    <b>PaaS</b> - Platform as a Service - Primarily used by developers to host applications they create, either in testing or production<br/>
    <b>IaaS</b> - Infrastructure as a Service - Used by SysAdmins of companies to offload workloads of local servers</p>
